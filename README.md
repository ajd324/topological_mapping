# topological_mapping

Used to dynamically create and save topological maps based on robot odometry and camera data using ROS pipeline. Press n to add a new node, e to add a new edge, p to print the current set of nodes and edges, and s to save the graph to a file in the directory. The directory should be changed depending on which folder you want to save the images and graphs to.

To run the script, simply type "rosrun x_directory graph_mapping_final.py" where x_directory is the folder that the script is saved in. Make sure the script is executable before running.
